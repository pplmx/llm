## Overview

`llm` is a Python project designed to [brief description of the project's main purpose or functionality]. This project aims to [explain the primary goals or problems it solves].

## Features

- **Feature 1**: [Detailed description of feature 1 and its benefits]
- **Feature 2**: [Detailed description of feature 2 and its benefits]
- **Feature 3**: [Detailed description of feature 3 and its benefits]
- **Advanced Training Script**: The `scripts/train_simple_decoder.py` script for training decoder-only models now supports:
    - Evaluation on a validation set during training (via the `--val_file_path` argument).
    - Learning rate scheduling using Cosine Annealing.
    - Early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting and reduce training time.
- [Add more features as needed]

## Quick Start

```python
import llm

# Example usage
result = llm.do_something()
print(result)

# Add more examples showcasing key features
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): A fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.

### Setting up the Environment

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and environment setup.

1.  **Install `uv`**: If you don't have `uv` installed, follow the official instructions [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).
2.  **Synchronize Dependencies**: Navigate to the project root directory and run:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This command will install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` (and captured in `uv.lock` if present), including main dependencies as well as those required for development, testing, and quality checks (e.g., `pytest`, `ruff`, `pytest-cov`).

### User Installation (Distribution)
If this project were to be distributed as a package, users would typically install it using pip:

```bash
pip install llm # Assuming 'llm' is the package name on PyPI
```
However, for development, `uv sync` is the recommended way to set up the environment.

## Usage

For comprehensive documentation, including detailed usage examples, development guides, and troubleshooting, please refer to our dedicated documentation section:

-   [Development Guide](docs/development.md)
-   [CPU LLM Tutorial](docs/tutorial-cpu-llm.md)
-   [Project Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)
-   [Training Framework Documentation](docs/training/README.md)


## Development

Setting up the development environment is handled by `uv sync` as described in the [Installation](#installation) section. This ensures all necessary tools for development, testing, and quality checks are installed.

### Code Style and Quality Checks

This project uses `ruff` for formatting and linting. All commands should be run from the project root.

-   **Format code (apply changes)**:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff format .
    ```
-   **Check formatting (without applying changes)**:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff format --check .
    ```
-   **Lint code (check for errors and style issues)**:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff check .
    ```
-   **Lint code and apply auto-fixes (for safe fixes)**:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff check . --fix
    ```
-   **Lint code and apply more aggressive auto-fixes (including potentially unsafe ones)**:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes
    ```

### Running Tests

Tests are managed and run using `pytest`. Ensure dependencies are synchronized with `uv sync` before running tests.

-   **Run all tests**:
    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```

For more detailed information on development workflows, advanced testing, and contribution guidelines, please refer to our [Development Guide](docs/development.md).
